*Garden of Blues* is a project born out of the 2018-present MIT Architecture lingo. Donna Haraway’s sci-fi storytellings and her idea of “sowing worlds” were quoted many a time. Octavia Butler’s “Dawn” was the MIT Library selected book for Fall 2018. And words/phrases such as “kinship,” “non-human agents,” “inter-species communing,” “ecology,” “biome,” “imaginaries,” and “speculative” were floating everywhere in the corridors of Building 4.

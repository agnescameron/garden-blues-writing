Semine realized a curious echo of her own biography in researching early records of recipes from the Malay world. She came across “Eurasian” women such as Beb Vuyk, author of “Groot Indonesisch Kookboek” (1973), and Ellice Handy, author of “My Favourite Recipes” (1952), who both documented overlaps between "local" and colonial/European cuisines. 

Beb Vuyk’s recipes are in the process of being translated. You can follow the project on [pisang.susu](https://pisangsusu.com "pisangsusu")
